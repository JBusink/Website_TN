## Problem solving

You are bound to run into lab exercises where circuits you built  either do not work or show unexpected behavior. Below some hints are given to prevent problems as much as possible and how to solve them if they still occur.
* Build well organized circuits:
    - Locate inputs on the left of your circuit board and outputs on the right.
    - Use different colors of wires for grounding, positive and negative poles of the power supply, inputs and outputs.
* Power supply: \
Switch on the power only after the circuit is complete, and switch off the power when you make changes to the circuit.
* Non-function circuit: 
    - Check whether the design of the circuit is correct.
    - Locate errors by splitting the overall circuit into smaller parts that can be tested separately (are expected outputs obtained for well defined inputs for the smaller parts?).
    - Next check all connections and check whether components used have the correct values. Check the resistance of wires used when in doubt. 

````{warning} 
Never replace a component without checking whether the connections are correct first. Particularly with the use of integrated circuits (ICs) like operational amplifiers (see {ref}`OpAmps`) often a wire is connected to a wrong pin, which may result in a blown-up IC. Simply replacing the component will result in the next IC being blown-up.
````

* Start all over again: \
If you cannot discover any mistake in (part of) a circuit rebuild it from scratch.
* Draw a schematic of your circuit on paper, and then compare it with your original design. This often quickly leads to tracing errors in the construction of your circuit.

## Reporting of lab exercises


* Theory
    - Either present derivations of formulas or give references to books or the syllabus where derivations can be found.

* Measurements
    - Record data in tables.
    - Specify physical quantities and units, and other relevant parameters (e.g. the frequency setting in an experiment) in table heading.

* Data analysis
    - Refer to the formulas used to determine the final results from measured physical quantities.
    - Show results in graphs if possible.
    - For each graph:
        - include the exercise number (particularly useful when several graphs are presented in one page), units, physical quantities and relevant parameters (e.g. the frequency setting in an experiment).
* Discussion of results \& conclusion
    - Do the results meet your expectation?
    - If not, try to present an explanation.

An example of a report on a lab exercise can be found on Canvas.

## Assessment
You will be graded for this course as follows:
- Test 1 (weight *17\%*) and test 2 (weight *17\%*)
- Average lab journal (3x) (weight *36\%*)
- Average (lab) work covering Ch. 5-6 and Ch. 7-8 (2x) (weight *30\%*)

To pass the course the final grade should be at least 5.5.
